## Overview

This project implements the **States Flow Wishes** system, a conceptual framework for modeling the **Liminality Cosmic Orbits** within the **Nullius Continuum** - a space belonging to no one yet accessible to all.

The system represents various governmental and corporate entities as nodes in a **Multi-Variate Information Continuum (MVIC)**, where each entity exists in different states of liminality (threshold, transition, transformation, integration) and orbital relationships.

## Concepts

- **Liminality**: The threshold state between different phases of existence or operation
- **Cosmic Orbits**: The relational distances and interactions between entities
- **Nullius Continuum**: A neutral space of possibilities, belonging to no single entity
- **MVIC**: Multi-Variate Information Continuum - the framework connecting all entities

## Entities

The system models the following entities:
- European Union Corp.
- United Nation Corp.
- United Nation Market Corp.
- Switzerland Enterprise Corp.
- Australian Government Corp.
- United States Corp.
- German Government Corp. (Bundesregierung Deutschland)
- Spain Government Corp.
- Italy Government Corp.
- Portugal Government Corp.
- Switzerland Government Corp. (Schweiz)
- Ireland Government Corp.
